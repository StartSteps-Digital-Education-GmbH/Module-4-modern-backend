## Exercise 1: Restructuring Express Routes Using `express.Router()`

### Objective

Refactor your existing Express routes into a separate router module using `express.Router()`. This will prepare your project for more complex routing and better organization.

### Learning Explanation

#### What is `express.Router()`?

`express.Router()` is a built-in Express module that allows you to organize your route handlers into modular, mountable route handlers. A `Router` instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a "mini-app".

Using `express.Router()` helps in:

- **Organizing Routes**: Keep your route definitions in separate files or modules for better maintainability.
- **Modularity**: Group related routes together, making it easier to manage and scale your application.

### Instructions

1. **Step 1:** Create a new file named `routes.ts` in your project directory.

   - **Explanation:** This file will hold all the route definitions that were previously in `index.ts`.

2. **Step 2:** Import `express` and create a router instance in `routes.ts`.

    ```typescript
    import express from 'express';
    const router = express.Router();
    ```

   - **Explanation:** The `router` instance will now handle all route definitions.

3. **Step 3:** Move all route definitions from `index.ts` to `routes.ts`.

    ```typescript
    // routes.ts
    import { Request, Response } from 'express';
    import { students, Student } from './dummyData';
    import { getHelloMessage } from './helpers';

    // Root route to display the custom message
    router.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
        res.send(getHelloMessage());
    });

    // GET endpoint to fetch all students, with optional filtering by grade
    router.get('/students', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
        const grade = req.query.grade as string;
        if (grade) {
            const filteredStudents = students.filter(s => s.grade === grade);
            if (filteredStudents.length > 0) {
                res.status(200).json(filteredStudents);
            } else {
                res.status(404).json({ message: `No students found with grade ${grade}` });
            }
        } else {
            res.status(200).json(students);
        }
    });

    // GET endpoint to fetch a specific student by ID with optional grade inclusion
    router.get('/students/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
        const studentId = parseInt(req.params.id);
        const includeGrade = req.query.includeGrade === 'true';
        const student = students.find(s => s.id === studentId);

        if (student) {
            const response = includeGrade ? student : { id: student.id, name: student.name };
            res.status(200)
                .set('X-Student-Found', 'true')
                .json({
                    success: true,
                    data: response,
                    message: 'Student retrieved successfully',
                });
        } else {
            res.status(404)
                .set('X-Student-Found', 'false')
                .json({
                    success: false,
                    message: 'Student not found',
                });
        }
    });

    // POST endpoint to add a new student with validation middleware
    router.post('/students', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
        console.log('Received Student Data:', req.body);
        const newStudent: Student = req.body;
        students.push(newStudent);
        res.status(201).json(newStudent);
    });

    // PUT endpoint to update a studentâ€™s grade
    router.put('/students/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
        const studentId = parseInt(req.params.id);
        const studentIndex = students.findIndex(s => s.id === studentId);

        if (studentIndex !== -1) {
            students[studentIndex].grade = req.body.grade;
            res.json(students[studentIndex]);
        } else {
            res.status(404).json({ message: 'Student not found' });
        }
    });

    // DELETE endpoint to remove a student
    router.delete('/students/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
        const studentId = parseInt(req.params.id);
        const studentIndex = students.findIndex(s => s.id === studentId);

        if (studentIndex !== -1) {
            students.splice(studentIndex, 1);
            res.status(204).send(); // No content after deletion
        } else {
            res.status(404).json({ message: 'Student not found' });
        }
    });

    export default router;
    ```

   - **Explanation:** By moving these routes, you're keeping your `index.ts` clean and focused only on application setup.

4. **Step 4:** Import `router` in `index.ts` and use it with `app.use()`.

    ```typescript
    import router from './routes';

    app.use('/api', router);
    ```

   - **Explanation:** Prefixing with `/api` means all your routes will be accessible under `/api`, e.g., `/api/students`.

### Best Practices

- **Modular Code:** Breaking down your application into modules makes it easier to manage and scale as your project grows.
- **Readability:** Keeping the main `index.ts` file clean improves readability and maintainability of your codebase.

## Exercise 2: Setting Up HTTP and HTTPS Servers in Node.js

### Objective

Configure both an HTTP and HTTPS server using Node.js, building upon your refactored Express project.

### Learning Explanation

#### Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** The foundation of data communication on the web. It's used to transfer data over the internet in an unsecured way.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** An extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the data transferred between the server and the client, providing a secure communication channel.

#### SSL Keys and Certificates

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):** A standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links between a web server and a browser.
- **SSL Certificates:** Files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization's details. When installed on a web server, it activates the padlock and the HTTPS protocol, allowing secure connections from a web server to a browser.

#### Best Practices for HTTPS

- **Always use HTTPS:** Especially when dealing with sensitive user data, like login credentials or payment information.
- **Use strong encryption:** Ensure your SSL certificates use strong encryption algorithms.
- **Regularly update certificates:** SSL certificates have expiration dates. Ensure they are regularly updated and renewed.

### Instructions

1. **Step 1:** Set up the HTTP server in `index.ts`.

    - Create a server that responds with "Hello from HTTP server" to all requests.

      <details>
      <summary>Click to reveal a hint for Step 1</summary>
  
      Use `http.createServer()`, `res.writeHead()` for the headers, and `res.end()` to send the response.
  
      </details>

2. **Step 2:** Make the server listen on port 3000 and log a message that it's running.

    <details>
    <summary>Click to reveal a hint for Step 2</summary>

    Use `server.listen(3000, () => console.log('HTTP server running on port 3000'))`.

    </details>

3. **Step 3:** Set up the HTTPS server in `index.ts` using SSL certificates.

    - Create a `cert` folder in your project and generate SSL certificates using OpenSSL. (See Exercise 3 for SSL generation steps.)

    - Set up the HTTPS server similarly to the HTTP server, but include the `key` and `cert` options.

      <details>
      <summary>Click to reveal a hint for Step 3</summary>

      Use `https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {...})` where `options` includes the SSL key and cert.

      </details>

4. **Step 4:** Make the HTTPS server listen on port 3443 and log a message that it's running.

    <summary>Click to reveal the solution & explanation</summary>

    ```typescript
    import http from 'http';
    import https from 'https';
    import fs from 'fs';
    import path from 'path';
    import express from 'express';
    import router from './routes';
    import { port } from './config';
    import { logServerMessage } from './logger';

    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json());
    app.use('/api', router);

    // HTTP Server
    const httpPort = 3000;
    const httpServer = http.createServer(app);
    httpServer.listen(httpPort, () => logServerMessage(`HTTP server running on http://localhost:${httpPort}`));

    // HTTPS Server
    const httpsPort = 3443;
    const options = {
        key: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'cert', 'key.pem')),
        cert: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'cert', 'cert.pem'))
    };
    const httpsServer = https.createServer(options, app);
    httpsServer.listen(httpsPort, () => logServerMessage(`HTTPS server running on https://localhost:${httpsPort}`));
    ```

    **Explanation:**
    - **HTTP Server Setup:** Simple HTTP server wrapping the Express app, running on port 3000.
    - **HTTPS Server Setup:** HTTPS server configured with SSL certificates, wrapping the same Express app, running on port 3443.

    </details>

### Best Practices

- **Secure Development:** Always develop with HTTPS in mind, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
- **Certificate Management:** In production, use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) instead of self-signed certificates.

## Exercise 3: Generating SSL Certificates Using OpenSSL

### Objective

Generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL for development purposes.

### Instructions

1. **Step 1:** Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. **Step 2:** Create a directory to store your certificates:

    ```bash
    mkdir cert
    ```

3. **Step 3:** Generate the SSL certificate and key using OpenSSL:

    ```bash
    openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout cert/key.pem -out cert/cert.pem -days 365
    ```

    - **Explanation:** This command generates a self-signed certificate (cert.pem) and a private key (key.pem) valid for 365 days. In a production environment, you'd use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority instead.

4. **Testing**

    After generating the certificates, restart your Node.js server. You should now be able to access `https://localhost:3443` in your browser. Youâ€™ll see a security warning because the certificate is self-signed, which is normal for development.

## Exercise 4: Serving a Simple HTML Form Over HTTPS

### Objective

Create and serve an HTML form over your HTTPS server.

### Instructions

1. **Step 1:** Create a new file named `form.html` in your project directory with the following content:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>HTTPS Form</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form action="/submit" method="POST">
            <label for="message">Enter your message:</label>
            <input type="text" id="message" name="message">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. **Step 2:** Modify your HTTPS server code to serve this form when a GET request is made to the root URL (`/`).

    <details>
    <summary>Click to reveal a hint for Step 2</summary>

    Use `fs.readFile()` to read the `form.html` file and `res.end(data)` to send the content as the response.

    </details>

3. **Step 3:** Provide a placeholder response for POST requests to `/submit`.

    **Need help?** Reveal the solution below, but please try by yourself first!

    <details>
    <summary>Click to reveal the solution & explanation</summary>

    ```typescript
    import path from 'path';

    const httpsServer = https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
        if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') {
            const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'form.html');
            fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
                if (err) {
                    res.writeHead(500);
                    res.end('Error loading the form');
                } else {
                    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
                    res.end(data);
                }
            });
        } else if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/submit') {
            res.writeHead(200);
            res.end('Form submitted');
        }
    });
    ```

    **Explanation:**
    - **GET Request:** Serves the HTML form when the root URL is accessed.
    - **POST Request:** Provides a basic response indicating form submission.

    </details>

### Best Practices

- **Serving Static Files:** Ensure that HTML files like `form.html` are stored in a location accessible to the server, such as the `dist` folder after a build process.
- **Form Action & Method:** The `action` attribute specifies where the form data is sent, and `method` specifies how the data is sent (GET or POST).

---

## Conclusion

These exercises have introduced you to creating secure web servers using Node.js. You've learned how to:

- Set up both HTTP and HTTPS servers
- Generate self-signed SSL certificates for development
- Serve HTML content over HTTPS
- Handle form submissions securely

Remember, while self-signed certificates are fine for development, always use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority in production environments. Practice these concepts and try extending the functionality, such as storing submitted messages in a database or creating more complex HTML forms.
