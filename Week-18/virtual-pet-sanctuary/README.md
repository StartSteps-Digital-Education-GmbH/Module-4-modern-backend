# Virtual Pet Sanctuary
**Virtual Pet Sanctuary** code example is likely a full-stack application built using TypeScript, Express, and GraphQL. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code covers:

### 1. TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)

- **Compiler Options**: The configuration specifies various TypeScript compiler options, such as:

- `target`: The version of JavaScript to compile to (ES2017).

- `module`: The module system to use (NodeNext).

- `rootDir` and `outDir`: Directories for source files and compiled output.

- `strict`: Enables strict type-checking options for better type safety.

- `esModuleInterop`: Allows for easier imports of CommonJS modules.

**Notes**:

- Think of TypeScript as a safety net for your JavaScript code. The `tsconfig.json` file is like a recipe that tells the TypeScript compiler how to cook your code.

- The `target` is the final dish (JavaScript version), while `strict` ensures every ingredient (variable) is measured correctly to avoid mistakes.

### 2. Package Configuration (`package.json`)

- **Project Metadata**: Contains basic information about the project, such as name, version, and description.

- **Scripts**: Defines scripts for building the project (`tsc`) and running the server in development mode (`node dist/server.js`).

- **Dependencies**: Lists the required packages for the project, including:

- `apollo-server-express`: For integrating Apollo Server with Express.

- `express`: The web framework for building the server.

- `graphql`: The GraphQL library.

- `ws`: WebSocket library for real-time communication.

- **DevDependencies**: Lists development-only packages, such as TypeScript and type definitions for Express.

**Notes**:

- Imagine `package.json` as a shopping list for your project. It tells you what ingredients (dependencies) you need to cook your application.

- The `scripts` section is like a set of cooking instructions, guiding you on how to build and run your project.

### 3. Server Setup (`src/server.ts`)

- **Express Server**: Sets up an Express server that listens on port 4000.

- **Middleware**: Configures middleware to parse JSON requests and sets up routing for the `/api/pets` endpoint.

- **Apollo Server (commented out)**: There is a commented-out section for setting up Apollo Server, indicating that GraphQL functionality may be planned for future implementation.

**Notes**:

- The server setup is like opening a restaurant. The Express server is the building where customers (clients) come to place their orders (requests).

- Middleware acts like the staff who prepare the orders, ensuring everything is ready before serving it to the customers.

### 4. Routing (`src/routes.ts`)

- **Express Router**: Defines RESTful API routes for managing pets, including:

- `GET /`: Retrieve all pets.

- `GET /:id`: Retrieve a specific pet by ID.

- `POST /`: Create a new pet.

- `PATCH /:id`: Update a pet's happiness.

- `DELETE /:id`: Delete a pet.


**Notes**:

- Routing is like a menu in a restaurant. It lists all the dishes (endpoints) available for customers to order.

- Each route corresponds to a specific dish, allowing customers to choose what they want (perform CRUD operations on pets).

### 5. Pet Data Management (`src/petData.ts`)

- **Pet Interface**: Defines a TypeScript interface for a pet, including properties like `id`, `name`, `species`, and optional properties like `color` and `size`.

- **In-Memory Data Store**: Uses an array to store pet data and provides CRUD operations:

- `getPets`: Retrieve all pets.

- `getPet`: Retrieve a pet by ID.

- `createPet`: Create a new pet and assign it a unique ID.

- `updatePetHappiness`: Update the happiness level of a pet.

- `deletePet`: Remove a pet from the array.


**Notes**:

- This module is like a storage room for all the pets. It keeps track of each pet's details and allows you to add, update, or remove pets as needed.

- The interface is like a label on each pet's cage, ensuring you know exactly what information is stored for each one.

### 6. Controller Logic (`src/controller.ts`)

- **Controller Functions**: Implements the logic for handling requests and responses for the pet-related routes:

- Retrieves all pets or a specific pet.

- Creates a new pet with validation.

- Updates a pet's happiness or deletes a pet, returning appropriate responses.

**Notes**:

- Controllers are like the chefs in the kitchen. They take the orders (requests), prepare the food (process data), and serve it to the customers (send responses).

- Each controller function focuses on a specific task, ensuring that everything runs smoothly in the kitchen.


### 7. GraphQL Structure (Placeholder)

- **GraphQL Directory**: The presence of a `graphql` directory suggests that the project may also implement GraphQL functionality, with files for resolvers and schema definitions. However, the actual content of these files is not provided.


**Notes**:

- The GraphQL structure is like a flexible menu that allows customers to customize their orders. Instead of choosing from fixed options, they can specify exactly what they want.

- This flexibility can make it easier to serve complex requests without overwhelming the kitchen with too many orders.

### What, Why, and How ?
Below are three questions (What, Why, and How) answered for each major topic covered in the provided code example.

### 1. TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
